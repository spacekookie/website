If you don't already know, sieve (/siÀêv/) is an e-mail filtering language.
It's not touring complete (i.e. it doesn't allow recursion) 
and has been defined through a series of RFCs for the base language
as well as several extentions.

The RFCs aren't exactly nice to read.
But luckily, there are plenty of tutorials on the internet,
that try to explain sieve.
Unfortunately most of them are garbage.

The main reason for this is, that the articles never deal
with a realistic set of constraints of requirements
