For as long as I can remember I've wanted to build my own computer. Sorta from scratch. 

And there is something I want to do even more: build a GPU. Something that can process vectors and matrecies in an efficient manner, build a graphics rendering pipeline in hardware. Sorta from scratch.

And that's what this project is about. OpenMCU stands for "Open Matrix Computation Unit" and will be a part of the OpenGPU (working title).
