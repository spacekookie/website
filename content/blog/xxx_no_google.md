Once in a while (about every 6-9 months or so), I get an e-mail like this in my inbox:

> Hi Katherina,
> 
> Hope you are doing well. I'm a tech sourcer with Google working on the
> expansion of our Europe software engineering teams. I came across your
> linkedin and github profiles and I'm interested in finding more about your
> experience. Would you be open having a quick formal chat about our current
> teams and projects we have across Europe to see if there's anything that
> may interest you?

I always send the same polite decline, wishing them a nice day.
And a few months later, someone else will e-mail me the exact same question.


I know that a few years ago, when Google first reached out to me to ask me
if I was interested in working for them, I was quite excited about the idea.
Since then a lot of things have changed, including my attitudes towards
big companies, and Google in particular.
