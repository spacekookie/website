The title should be self explanatory about that one ðŸ˜Š

But let me go back a little bit. A couple of weeks ago I sat in the basement of my local hackerspace talking to a friend about crypto when somebody joined the conversation, asking if I was a student and if I might be interested in Google Summer of Code.

After I looked up the project and familiarised myself with what had to be done, I thought it would be interesting to try to apply. And so I did. I wrote a long-ish proposal of what I wanted to do, how I would do it and when exactly I would acomplish my goals. (You can read my original proposal [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/summerofcode-prod.appspot.com/gsoc/core_project/doc/1458924075_GSOCProposal-KatharinaSabel.pdf?Expires=1461863360&GoogleAccessId=summerofcode-prod%40appspot.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=h0y5Nzi7llFNWKzt9%2BLGLvxcAPZ%2FaO7ni1ZyRDA3uFi6PD%2BDBmtIB6RJAr4Ulhv6fe64IFyB%2FI9iuVIYWIInYTmN7pZ9aUxw6TgxgFYguIywfcE2yUZ4o5UKb0PUbwI0Pu7o6mq%2BzSDXqlegpVOgujQ9k2QuTg1T1CqGzSi%2FnC4u6H0mB%2BxzWGGpoBC6rFwkKM1S70gE7hJ0EZpgYWr9H9zKPcwrfPtx99zqb488sH6STGYJf4tFrDRnnr57k2zbSN%2BO17chZtVBjGUYrKoyU6B%2FGB8MexFE6rmYaTCr5AjgqGWm97VCCwZkpHbRiTtFH5yT825G9%2FkRPYHkxsPnCw%3D%3D))

In the meantime I actually had a sit-down with my mentor (the person joining the conversation in that basement) and made further plans how to implement things.

And so this is it. The next month or so I will have time to get to know the code base of the project (although I partially already have), meet more people from the community and generally get into the rythm of what GSoC is.

I will be posting three blog posts on the official [Freifunk Blog](http://blog.freifunk.net/), one in a couple of days/ weeks, one in the height of the project and one that will go into the aftermath of the project.

But in the meantime I will be keeping my blog up to date about what I am doing, how things are going, my challenges and things I learn.
In the hopes that people might find it useful and lean things from it. Or just to save my insane ramblings in some narcissistic pleasure...to think that I am relevant in the world ðŸ˜œ

Read you soon,

Kate
