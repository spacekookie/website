Title: Some website design changes

Howdy, it's that time of year again where I apparently do design
things on this website (the last article is from exactly 2 years ago).
Apologies if you've never been to my website and only use the [RSS]
feed.  Also: you're cool!

In previous iterations of this series I tended to fundamentally change
the way that the website worked, either by changing the way that the
html was generated, or by cutting down/ adding categories.  This time
I'm doing none of that.

Indeed things are getting simpler but mostly on the CSS side of
things.  I was able to delete about half of my CSS which is a pretty
cool.  The biggest change in the way the website looks is the article
overview and the article pages themselves.

Generally I didn't like the card design style very much anymore so I
wanted to change that.  But I also wanted to make it simpler to see
all my articles at a glance, without any summaries.  I feel this makes
the blog feel more "web log-y", which I like.  It also means it's now
consistently bright text on dark background and I think I've gotten
the typography down enough to make it all pretty.

Anyway, there's more things I wanted to do but those will come later.
I should also point out that my primary code host for this website
isn't github anymore.  It's now hosted on [sourcehut] and
collaborations are still welcome (if you see a typo or have general
comments), albeit not with pull requests anymore. You can submit
patches to my [public inbox] which I have hinted at in a previous
article.

In post-congress news I seem to have caught a cold, so: bye.
