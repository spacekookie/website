It's winter, rebuilding my website is a tradition...right? **Happy new year everybody.**

This has been a long time coming. I've not really been happy with the way my website looked for a while and have been playing around with new designs for the past few months. I also took that opportunity to throw out a few old articles, fix formatting on others and generally do house-keeping.

The whole thing is still using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) to generate pages but now with a completely new theme and new plugins 🎉

This re-design also decreases complexity. The old theme was massively too complicated and I've now taken it down to 3 (or 4?) templates. Working around the old theme and what Pelican expected was an interesting experience. Especially since it felt less like building a website and more like working with a game engine where small changes make lots of magic happen and *voilá*.

There are a few things I want to write about...*soon*. Until then, there is an easteregg hidden somewhere. Let's see who finds it first 😉
