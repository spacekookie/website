Title: Starting a public inbox

I've been a lot more active on this blog in the last year than I have
previously, and that makes me pretty happy. I'm trying to become less
obsessed about publishing only perfect diamonds made of words, but
instead also publishing articles that might still have some flaws or
that I haven't rewritten twelve times yet ;)

As a result of this I have actually gotten more and more e-mails by
people saying that they read my blog, giving me feedback and sometimes
submitting patches to my [website] repository to fix typos or bad
formatting. And that's pretty cool.

Recently I started thinking if the format of e-mail might not be well
suited for comments as well. Not just to me, but to allow other
readers to talk _about_ the stuff I post. I wasn't super sure if this
was such a great idea, after all...this is the internet we're talking
about. Someone will be an asshole and ruin it for everybody.

Then I discovered Drew DeVaults `public-inbox` mailing list,
which is basically exactly what I thought about creating,
hosted on source hut.

It might still be a terrible idea, but it's one I wanna try. I also
wanna automatically post new blog posts _to_ the mailing list, as
plain text, so people don't have to fuss around with my RSS feed if
they don't want to. I will host my `public-inbox` on source hut for
now too, especially considering that I've been trying it out for a lot
of smaller personal stuff, it makes sense. And I really quite like it
(might write about that in the future too)

So, if you have comments, questions or want to fix typos,
feel free to check out my [public-inbox][inbox]

Let's see how this goes then ðŸ˜€
